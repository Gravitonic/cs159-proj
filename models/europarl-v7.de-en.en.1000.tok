we do not believe that we should cherry-pick .
but this is not what happens .
of course , if a drug addict becomes a pusher , then it is right and necessary that he should pay and answer before the law also .
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin by thanking mr burtone for his report .
' legal drugs ' ( tranquillizers ) finding their way on to an illegal market , especially when used in combination with alcohol , are a major and serious problem particularly for young people .
i should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to mr titley .
it was a very difficult position and i therefore am delighted about the new agreement .
we must accept that , in the realm of blood and plasma collection , the systems vary and operate on mixed bases .
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
to this end the oostlander report takes substantial note of the european commission guidelines which are very clear , very precise and do not leave room for subjective interpretation .
europe should not get over ambitious by trying to manage public health policy .
in any event , the national front demands that the peoples of europe should be directly consulted in a referendum to decide on the approval or rejection of maastricht ii .
the authors of the report consider that enlargement to the east is undoubtedly possible in theory , but will be far more difficult in practice .
i would ask you , members of the european parliament present here , to support this amendment by mrs stenius-kaukonen which all members of the finnish parliament across party boundaries support .
they are silting up .
france was the first to take diplomatic and humanitarian action .
i constantly bring this matter up both in writing to the president and to the heads of the political groups .
question no 7 by mar�a izquierdo rojo ( h-0252 / 96 )
it is a question of how decisions are taken , that is to say whether this is done on the basis of a vote or of consensus , and whether unanimity is required or some form of qualified majority .
nepal is very high up and helping this country where needs are very great must also be high up on our list .
this commitment to negotiations between the social partners could initially be reached on four matters , which seem to me essential , as of now . negotiations must begin .
the committee on transport and tourism has adopted four amendments for the second reading .
they will certainly enhance the feeling of the right of movement by eu citizens and they will also certainly benefit disabled drivers .
the initial commission proposal was adopted unamended by parliament on first reading .
europe in particular has to remain a leading player if it is to safeguard its international competitiveness , not only in terms of economic performance but also in the exploitation and widespread application of new forms of technology .
the absence of harmonized rules governing intellectual property is not unique to europe .
we are giving a clear political signal to the moroccan authorities to continue along the road towards liberalization , political as well as economic .
both demand a credible and active policy to reduce co2 emissions through a combination of incentive , regulation and progressive taxation .
this is something which the committee as a whole felt strongly about in the resolution on the annual economic report and it is a significant omission that it is not in the resolution to wind up this debate .
it is like the story of plato and the cave ; it is the signifier , not the signified .
the committee on transport would therefore have been well advised to devote rather more attention to that committee 's proposals , which were adopted with the strong backing of the ppe group and the support of the socialist members .
in ten years , our dependence on fish imports has increased by 30 % ; and the processing industry depends almost entirely on imported fish .
i hope we can look at and address properly the issue of quota hoppers .
the commission heeded this call .
subject : tendering procedures for mobile phone licences
this means that terrestrial frequencies may face new competition in a form over which europeans no longer have any influence .
what i am saying is that we agree with the house on the need for action .
thank you very much , mr bangemann .
this sort of ungentlemanly conduct is not acceptable .
it does not solve the employment problem if the most we can do is offer firms new profit margins , which provides no guarantee of employment , and also damages the environment and social security .
it is all very well to have common minimum rules on the employment of children , but my wife and i do not need an eu directive to decide whether our son should deliver newspapers .
so it is also necessary to establish very quickly whether the international presence in bosnia , so fundamental to any reconstruction effort , is to continue .
i am grateful to the president-in-office for his answer . however , i am sorry to have to say that the results of the di roberto mission fall short of our expectations .
therefore there is a need for a european directive .
the procedure followed : complaints declared admissible and prima facie founded are communicated to the institution or body in question , which is asked to give a first opinion .
the work of the european ombudsman and the petitions committee is complementary .
the annual activity report clearly states how the ombudsman 's office works and what citizens should do if they want to take matters to the ombudsman for consideration .
her supporters know that by gathering together they are defying the ruling junta .
the military authorities are still playing too great a part in the social and political life of that nation .
the report clearly defines which beverages may be bottled in sparkling wine bottles .
because cr�mant , which has acquired its patent of nobility here , is not an issue just for one region but for the european union , too .
since we took the initiative of tabling the oral question there has been some progress .
but our first concern is to preserve fish stocks , and especially herring stocks .
the commission , for its part , will continue to play an active part in the intergovernmental conference .
let me say to mrs green and the other members that it is not true that the conciliation agreement with the european parliament on the infrastructure projects was unilaterally changed at florence .
another problem the molitor group does not sufficiently deal with is implementation .
the same difficulty applies , mutatis mutandis as far as the european parliament is concerned .
the resolution submitted by our committee on women 's rights deserves the support of the european parliament , the commission and the council .
my answer - and i hope parliament 's too - will be a directive aimed at introducing a statutory right to interest for firms paid unwarrantably late .
it is an especial problem for our 17 million small and medium-sized enterprises .
it is local authorities and large organization , quangos and national governments which are by and large responsible for a very high proportion of that .
madam president , the european council in florence gave the impression of enormous confusion where the problems of employment are concerned .
i took it over at the beginning of this parliament , a lot of the work on it having already been done by a colleague of mine , claude delcroix .
representatives of all sectors of industry have indicated , at a public hearing , that they see huge problems with the commission proposals .
firstly , in drawing up any new proposal , the council and the commission must take account of the views of the trade unions .
are there any other comments ?
we therefore wish to see clear wording here as well .
nevertheless , the rejection of consumptive embryo research - and on this point we are agreed - requires consistency .
no such decision has as yet been taken .
the scheme was to be set up this autumn and the aid paid direct to women 's networks by the commission .
i therefore congratulate the european parliament for having organized this debate , and would end by thanking you for inviting the commission to take part in it .
how can one remain independent or claim to be combating corruption if , at the same time , one is in receipt of largesse , obviously with strings attached ?
citizens have a better grasp of their rights and obligations .
and the dublin european council will reconfirm 1 january , 1999 as the beginning of the third stage of emu .
in my view that reinforces the argument that one should not believe that emu will automatically mean jobs .
the first one is in relation to the helms-burton legislation and our relations with the united states .
if you look at parliament 's diary for 1997 , you will find that 8 and 15 september are actually sundays and week-ending days , not week-beginning days .
meier recommendation for second reading
recently a german council official told me that his brussels office might as well be in bonn , as his main point of reference was the german foreign ministry .
we refer to this in paragraph 4 of our resolution , the fourth indent , where we specifically state that the current approach is based on wishful thinking .
a major part of this work will be ensuring greater economic policy coordination between all 15 member states .
this would cut down a great deal on abductions .
traditionally , responsibility for decisions on custody has rested with national authorities .
of course there is a difference .
at the same time , i cannot approve of terrorist acts in any form .
the volume of production in the sheepmeat sector is only 10 to 15 % of that in the beef and veal sector .
this is the whole point !
the necessary correction will be made .
madam president , our main concern through this report and through this vote was , once more , to make it clear to the commission that we will not accept further cuts in spending on development .
but yesterday 's papers said that heineken had not in fact pulled out .
the repatriation operations are progressing smoothly .
israel also points the way in the production of educational software .
at the same time , it contributes to a reduction in the amount of beef produced .
i thus look forward eagerly to the commission 's communication and i should like to start this debate afresh with a number of questions .
i know that it is not easy , or something that can be achieved by tomorrow morning . speaking for myself , i simply want us to be able to conduct our deliberations on a more reliable basis .
the commission has not even got as far as submitting a proposal .
we do not need a central office for the whole of europe which centrally compiles all the offences that have to be entered in the record of penalty points !
but i would like to know what percentage of all customs officials in those countries are trained to operate this kind of system .
how is it possible for the commission to extend the transit system to other eastern countries before a system in collapse has been completely reformed in order to curb fraud ?
we believe that the resources should be increased in line with the problems and needs of our country and that measures must be put in place to speed up the absorption of funding and to monitor its use .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
finally , paragraph 93 states that the extreme right-wing parties advocate xenophobia .
asking for asylum is not a crime , and should not be treated as such .
( rapporteur : mr van der waal ) .
there is a need for continuity in decisions of the kind we have already taken here in the house on telecommunications infrastructure .
we need detailed , concrete proposals .
unfortunately , at this stage the running is being made by american companies and we are much slower in catching up on development of this software .
consequently , as my report says , this is what we must do .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the igc must amend the treaty so that it includes the fundamental right of equality between the sexes , but yet more is needed .
some are unnecessary because they are already covered while others are not acceptable because they would mean changing existing law .
we must face up to the fact that we are talking about a redistribution of income and face what that involves .
the banning of overtime will deprive blue-collar workers of additional earnings , and they will not be able to make ends meet with their basic pay alone .
in the case of these substances , applications are made for the community to fix maximum residue limits , as provided for in council regulation 2377 / 90 .
i hope it will spread around here .
at present , all radioactive waste on the peninsula is kept in medium-term storage facilities either on land or on board ships .
i would , therefore , like to conclude by saying that the commission is being asked to do things , and to mention five things that we are doing or that we will do .
on the other hand , knowledge , instant communications and mobility will be the characteristics of the twenty-first-century economy .
they do not understand why europe exists in theory but not in reality .
the fact of the matter is that in this century , 190 million people have been killed in wars , 60 million of those in europe .
the debate on the state of the european union is closed .
but that unfortunately has become a tradition !
telecommunications services ' whereas we are in fact talking about the linking of the facilities of organizations providing telecom services , which is the wording of the original version and which we would prefer .
i consider the establishment of a european mark that indicates conformity with european standards as an appropriate tool of quality policy that can contribute to improving our competitive position .
are the controls able to be exercised properly and to what extent are they actually effective ?
that is something our citizens can understand .
so , congratulations to the organizers and to the european community mission .
this may have been thanks to the sensible approach of the leading parties or to the absence of the other ethnic group , but it was certainly also thanks to the presence of i-for .
they were deliberately processed so slowly by the serbs that many of them were unable to vote .
a. even in a highly liberalized market , works of art constitute an exception .
surely not .
we believe there is no way that alcohol consumption can be described as ' beneficial in moderation ' .
we have some of the finest dairy and beef herds but we also know everything about bse , which has hit us more than other areas .
madam president , i will make my contribution as brief as possible to make it easier for us to deal with the entire agenda .
madam president , surely we must take things seriously !
i shall therefore now also give the floor to mr dell ' alba once again on a point of order .
the common position does indeed incorporate many of the amendments proposed by parliament at first reading .
i think that i echo the whole house in wishing you , on behalf of all our colleagues , all the very best for your political career in your home country , austria . you have our warmest wishes .
let us think back to the television without frontiers directive , parliament 's first reading of which was completely ignored , because the commission preferred to take the council 's side .
for example , we were to maintain an open and transparent dialogue which would be accessible to the man in the street , an agreement which was defined in greater detail in the declaration of 25 october 1993 .
at the start of 1996 , there were 21 392 .
there is no hesitation in talking about ' reserves which are contrary to the principles of budgetary orthodoxy ' .
the next item is question time to the commission ( b4-0971 / 96 )
it highlights in particular the advantages offered by short-sea shipping in the baltic as a means of access to scandinavia and to the cis .
whilst i support everything that my colleague , ms morgan has said , it is a wider issue than that .
if research has been carried out by several people or institutions in various different countries , it could be almost impossible to obtain consent .
the second point relates to a suitable budgetary allocation , as opposed to that proposed by the council , which is totally inadequate and unacceptable .
with its proposal , the commission is well on the way to undermining the whole point of the e number system .
but i must also remind you that i have received six motions for resolutions to close this debate .
the world poverty summit in copenhagen last year set us all the ambitious aim of eliminating absolute poverty world-wide .
i doubt whether the countries in question will vote for the proposal at the intergovernmental conference .
the danish social democrats have voted in favour of the proposal to amend the list of extraction solvents , since the change does not affect the level of protection in denmark .
we call on it for a burst of courage .
i had asked about the development of the single european market , in which three of the four freedoms are a danger , in my belief , to children .
we must therefore ensure that we conduct a policy in member states which makes young people and others say no to narcotics .
it concerns the approximation not just of type approval but also of technical tests and integrating them on a european basis .
this initiative appears totally inopportune in a context of budget austerity .
it is true that to accept the challenge would have had the effect of endangering the interinstitutional agreement and starting a budget dispute .
culture is being exterminated .
if there is no conclusive decision from the government , cereal production will deteriorate further in 1997 and 1998 .
mr president , i agree with the previous speaker ; unfortunately it is easy to see in the case of belarus what the legacy of the soviet union still means today .
would it not be more correct , legally speaking , to place the measures under the third pillar and act at an intergovernmental level ?
i therefore call again on the commission to start and close negotiations in good time in future so that the proper consultation procedure can be concluded and a legal base adopted before payments are made .
the industry was expecting that .
this is a hypocritical budget heading , given the environmental damage that we cause in our own countries .
it may be that media interest in aids in the developing countries has declined , but in any event it is not a major subject of public debate at the moment .
i think that that is the very great merit of mrs mcnally 's position and i must therefore congratulate her on her report .
in a nutshell , we believe it is right to be concerned about this issue , but this is the wrong legislation .
we shall seek to promote greater cohesion between the regions via improvement of the transfer of know-how on aspects of energy-saving strategy from regions with a developed energy efficiency dynamic to regions which are significantly behind in that respect .
i now come to the statement of assurance .
i am happy to inform you today that i was able to present a first report to ecofin yesterday .
both of these considerations have to be taken into account in our decision concerning the legal imposition of compulsory quotas of european productions in television broadcasts .
it is currently a matter of regret to us that the hautala report has not provided the opportunity for real coordination of community policies on competition , industrial policy , trade and the internal market .
it appears from contacts with the commission that this is a problem in cross-border traffic in other member states , too .
this is a view we do not in any way share .
let me start by restating our determination that the european union should play its part in this process , as indeed it is already doing through substantial economic and financial aid .
a minimum with exceptions is not a minimum .
but perhaps the commission could also answer the question , or else it could do something very simple .
i hope , therefore , that there will be some further attention to procedures so that we can be accountable .
parliament has adopted amendments which define nuclear technology as unsustainable , and here we all need to clarify what we mean with regard to sustainability and the nuclear issue .
it is vital for both farmers and the industry for the commission to introduce a specific support system for non-food crops and to that end i call for a separate system of support for these crops .
the joint debate is closed .
in order to makes fisheries relations clearer and simpler , in 1995 the commission received a mandate to negotiate new framework agreements with the baltic republics to replace all existing fisheries agreements .
it is calculated that no duty is currently paid on 80 % of imported flowers .
i nevertheless , as a realist , acknowledge that it is a fact .
i also wanted to say that a few minutes ago parliament received a petition signed by the largest number of people ever .
this plan will , of course , be adapted according to new developments in the region but the basic assumptions will , however , remain relevant .
one aspect will be that we ensure proper trials for those guilty of genocide .
a council working group has been examining the two proposals and on 11 november ecofin noted that substantial progress had been made , particularly on the article 235 proposal .
even today , the gap between the highest and lowest deficits among the eu states has become significantly narrower , and that trend must continue .
and finally , the most dramatic tragedy of all is that the market is global but the single currency will only be european .
finally , commissioner , and my concluding remarks are addressed particularly to you , obviously we would not want this own-initiative report to be just one more document on your table .
the criteria vary and the member states consider that they are carried out by certain official services alone .
this assertion seems incorrect .
living out an example is the most effective method of prevention .
under the guise of harmonization , you will destroy social security .
i should now like to refer to a second , completely different issue .
it would cost �s 702 billion for the ccee to comply with the eu water directive alone .
thank you , commissioner .
at the same time , i am disappointed that none of the legally binding agreements which have been made within the framework of interstate cooperation have yet come into force .
the negotiations for an agreement on trade and cooperation between the european union and south africa are between those countries and not between the european union and southern africa .
does this mean that , at the dublin summit , the uk will be the only member state not to have pilot action programmes for the local and regional territorial pacts for employment ?
madam president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , this is the second reading of the electricity directive , which is designed to create an internal market in electricity .
we will be supporting only these amendments , not the others , because we want the single electricity market to begin operation as soon as possible .
according to the case law of the european court of justice , a directive which has been adopted but not transposed is an adequate legal basis for claims by third parties .
complaints have already been made , in france , mr cot , as you know .
mr president , i tried to revert to the minutes before you moved on .
we are not opposed to this provided that the word definitive is not interpreted as ' standardised ' .
human rights throughout the world in 1995-1996
because only in that way will it be possible to bring an end to the brutal and abhorrent exploitation of the young .
we are calling for all these facts to be taken into consideration and for the case to be re-examined .
so i read that newspaper , and i think there are many newspapers that would not have the confidence to attack their government the way globus does .
we have no complaints about you , quite the opposite , you have shown courage and insight in recent months .
of course international intervention was an absolute must , an obligation , and we did not do what was necessary .
it is necessary , therefore , to provide a specific policy for the wetlands , based on their geographical areas .
in principle , we agreed with mrs lindeperg 's motion for a resolution and its criticism of the inadequacies in the area of the third pillar .
i am a holder of what is called the orange badge in the united kingdom , and that will be affected by any changes that would be made as a result of this recommendation coming into being .
approval of the minutes
i must say it was unfortunate that she chose my report about which to make it .
if we accept that work makes an essential contribution to people 's prosperity and wellbeing , the same certainly holds good for disabled people too .
i have said it before and i say it again , we know who was poisoning the whole of europe .
in this case the compensation exceeds the share of the budget allocated to spain , resulting in a reduction in the compensation payments for all spanish producers in the 1997 harvest .
do not forget , ladies and gentlemen , do not forget that the essence of a democracy is not that what the majority says , goes .
i believe this message must be heeded .
i would also ask you to bear in mind the fact that no objections were made concerning this vote when the minutes were submitted for approval on the following day .
madam president , i also wish to express my best wishes to the dutch presidency .
in short , we need to ensure that the information society offers equal opportunities and mutual benefits to all .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m .
we could , of course , have shown greater courage for co-determination and not for reduced participation , precisely because we were not under pressure of time .
i urge that we keep national traditions but at the same time advance democracy in the world of work at the european level .
the commission wanted to include the budgetary provisions in the proposals .
mr president , first i want to express my appreciation of the fine resolution in this annual debate on racism and xenophobia .
first of all , the fact that we should not and cannot deal with or look upon terrorist acts as something requiring exceptional procedures or legislation .
the reding report is therefore both timely and important .
it is a mistake to assume that effectiveness is the same as supranationality .
at least we are making a start with implementing the noble aims set out in the energy charter .
there may be a simple explanation , and this may be due to a little slip-up or mistake in the administration .
there is just one more point i should like to make about this whole situation .
we believe that this situation must be reversed , and that social cohesion has to be our prime concern .
i must inform you that for technical reasons it was not possible to translate , print and distribute all of the amendments to this report in all languages .
for the sake , of course , of the unbridled pursuit of profit of monetarism and high finance .
i shall therefore concentrate on the part played by the commission in this affair .
i should like to end by adapting a traditional saying : ' friends of plato , but friends of the truth even more ' .
the report recognizes the amount of money spent on research .
nor do we want witch-hunts or soundbite sensationalism when we are assigning blame .
i should like to know how the commission intends to shoulder this responsibility .
regarding infringements , i just mentioned one case vis-�-vis one member state .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his comprehensive reply .
question no 60 by hubert pirker ( h-0036 / 97 )
the commissioner seems at a complete loss having received the report of the agency which the commission itself commissioned .
it is a question of how determined we are to regulate in order to create the modes of transport we wish to see .
i would also like to thank the committee on budgets which sent a letter with their comments on the report .
there the similarity between me and mr bangemann probably ends .
i should just like to ask commissioner fischler one question : how long is the transition phase ?
why did mr delors not come forward to protect and defend the commission ?
takes guard against the privatization of social risks , especially with regard to health ' .
it requires clearly defined marking , and not least it requires information as to what the markings mean .
i hope to have answered all the questions .
both sides are waging the political struggle remorselessly and it has been going on for years now .
european-level regulation of mortgage credit would therefore mean approximating the security and application rules at the same time , hence ultimately the eu-wide harmonization of national property law provisions .
i regret that , but , as you all know , the deadline of 1 january next year is putting pressure on us all .
if we require it to bear the additional burden of the social policy , we will be hounding more and more jobs out of europe .
we considered whether we should go on waiting for the directive , which is impossible in view of the date and the legal basis we are creating for national regulations , or whether we should accept a compromise .
it is sensible to strengthen consumer rights and interests in the area of financial services , banks and insurance services for example .
this issue is so grave that it is hard to understand how something like this could have happened in the european union .
chad
finally , the commission has also exerted pressure to have a clause inserted in the treaty , at the intergovernmental conference , prohibiting any form of racial discrimination .
we should also pay increasing attention - just as the rapporteur properly pointed out - to the interrelation between short , medium and long term types of aid , through a duly coherent approach .
in fact , the official journal has already published the commission 's regulation on the certificates that importers must hand over to the community 's customs authorities before furs can be imported .
that is why we are calling for guarantees for our citizens - it is clear that the tightening of security must not be used as a pretext to restrict their freedom !
after all the attention given to the electronic highway , the focusing of attention on the social aspects brought a breathing space .
it is not true , ladies and gentlemen , because there are no obsolete industries ; there are obsolete technologies .
we are voting for the report .
but of course we can define the conditions under which such an industry can operate more clearly than in the past .
the rapporteur has presented an excellent report .
information technology is only a support .
what is the commission doing to utilize phare programme funds more efficiently in the important preparatory stage ?
question no 22 by mr gallagher ( h-0181 / 97 )
thousands of kilometres away the fraudster is able to hoodwink the system , and this has been happening .
the work done by the committee of inquiry , which sheds so much light on the situation and provides strong political impetus , will be of great help when it comes to translating these initiatives into action .
i believe we can help the population more effectively in that way than by merely appearing as firefighters whenever there is a crisis .
those agreements are a source of employment for a very large number of structurally sensitive maritime regions .
i would therefore like to offer my thanks for your collaboration on this specific aspect .
i cannot vote in favour of this resolution because of the paragraphs on reinforced co-operation .
i could in fact have cut you off pursuant to rule 47 , mr pirker , because you were not speaking on the subject , but engaging in a discussion of principle .
now , the matter of women and the problematical situation of women in afghanistan .
now , three points related to this subject : a number of measures have been taken in connection with the specific subject of trade in human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation .
1997 is a year of major steps towards nuclear disarmament .
today , we are disappointed .
and yet gmos are not the panacea of agricultural development !
therefore i do not think that a number of you have been completely accurate today when you state that we did not take account of the fact that many member states were against the recommendation to approve this maize .
and it is not very polite to interrupt a colleague while he is speaking .
the notion of community financial assistance - that is the treaty 's expression - does not , indeed , exclude genuine budgetary interventions .
i must stress that for this process to be successful it must be inclusive .
masses and dimensions of motor vehicles
next , there is the underspend of the appropriations : some 20 % for the structural funds and 24 % for the european social fund , in particular .
i think that the report is excellent and it is good that three individual issues have been raised as tangible examples so that everyone may understand what this is about .
it is not easy in the commission but you know as well as i do that it will not be easy in parliament either .
that applies more particularly today , at a time when a gradual increase in tensions and difficulties is threatening to sweep us off course .
the commissioner was correct when he said that the crisis is political .
the irish presidency presented a compromise text on this at the council meeting of december last .
that broke the partnership , and the result of the broken partnership lies before you : a boring auto-oil concept that leads nowhere .
even so , we do agree with the objectives of fiorella ghilardotti 's report .
this will allow plenty of time for your amendments to be fully considered .
likewise the viewpoints of the scientists can change if they get together with the fishermen and find out that they are not all baddies , intent on destroying stocks .
the commission accepts the following amendments : no 1 as a recital and nos .
but , in a more general way , these obstacles result from the fact that the way of thinking in the sphere of academic recognition still prevails .
one of these instruments is precisely , within the framework of social protocol , social dialogue .
not at all !
it goes without saying that child pornography and racist material are outrageous . but a cross-border medium like the internet requires cross-border legislation , starting at the european level .
perhaps because it is starved of fuel , because the council refuses to free up enough funds for the various sme programmes . but that is not the main reason .
the committee supports the principle of today 's working party with regard to future maritime systems and strongly urges that this be extended to the fifth framework programme as well .
we know that driftnet fishing is unacceptable in the way that the catch of dolphins and turtles etc. is not to be recommended .
that speech may have been written yesterday , i do not know ; but it seems to me as if we are being treated as a rubber stamp .
the green paper addresses only the aspect of unauthorized reception of encrypted services .
our aim should therefore be to ensure that organic feeds are in fact used exclusively , with a suitable transition period .
it is a shame that it has taken so long to appear but , as they say , ' better late than never ' .
for example , not enough attention has been paid to the eu 's northern dimension .
at the same time , regulation no 2078 of 1992 on environmentally compatible agricultural production methods adapted to the landscape has also contributed substantially to this trend .
it will be possible to wage information society wars by means of the networks .
i am going to be asking you to be very dynamic and very cooperative .
these difficulties were all identified years ago but there seems there has been no way of solving them so far .
that is racism .
mr president , the two reports which have been discussed here this morning should set alarm bells ringing for most european citizens .
the truth is that our joint actions are unimpressive .
another factor also has to be borne in mind : there have as yet been relatively few rulings under the new procedure .
shortly after this meeting , mr kabila announced that the capital , kinshasa , would be taken by force if president mobutu did not resign within a week .
but even the safest power station is manned by people .
this objective unfortunately does not exert sufficient pressure to give priority to developing renewable sources of energy .
this has to be said quite plainly here .
this is highlighted by the ongoing concern in relation to the safety of nuclear installations , including sellafield , to which many people have referred during the earlier debate .
i am , therefore , against nuclear power practised in this way without any nuance .
lastly , we are angered by the provocative stance of the sudanese government vis � vis the repeated warnings by the international community , and in particular security council resolution 1070 of 16 august 1996 .
he has already spent 28 months in prison under very unpleasant conditions , with serious consequences for his physical and mental health .
whereas solar energy could be a solution in one region it is less viable in another , where perhaps water power or bio- energy would be more appropriate .
and what do we have here ?
we in the committee on budgets consider that this would be impossible to implement and would set an unacceptable precedent .
our citizens are demanding rights .
certainly this was a programme which brought great benefits in its day but these loans are less relevant now than they were .
secondly , the eurodac system is about the possibility of taking fingerprints in the case of asylum-seekers and has to do with the implementation of the dublin convention .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , parliament finds the proposal which is before us today to be very positive , commissioner .
let me conclude by asking the commissioner to tell us a little more in his address about other measures he is prepared to propose with the aim of further increasing safety on ferries .
mr president , my report also concerns agriculture , bee-keeping to be precise .
in fact i describe it to my constituents as the complaints department of the parliament .
this was sold when he was not looking .
we need a strict timetable , with updates standards and the european union must carry out regular checks and impose sanctions in cases of violations .
the main concern is unemployment .
in truth , the single currencies creates more problems than it solves and everyone knows that full well .
we need to know what are the revenue implications for states .
it is nonetheless important because , inevitably , the discussion on monetary union must be succeeded by an in-depth discussion on fiscal union , which must follow .
we disagree totally with the rapporteur 's proposals for a form of ' economic government ' the institutional edifice of the eu has no need of new political bodies or of any strengthening of the commission 's information-gathering powers .
i am glad to hear that the house supports the commission in those areas .
the commission 's consideration of the construction of freight freeways does not fully compensate for that omission .
but it is not a reason for simply shelving that procedure .
am i correct in assuming they are the stumbling block in this affair ?
so we want to start in 1997 to give ourselves enough time for a full revision .
i was obliged to make this request because i absolutely had to attend the proceedings of the dutch parliament this afternoon and i am particularly obliged to you for having agreed to hold this debate this evening .
as a parliament , are we or are we not a budgetary authority ?
so the biggest income loss will be borne by the markets that have not been reformed since 1992 rather than by those , such as cereals market , that have been reformed .
retailers , too , are calling for clear guidelines to ensure that they will not need to be ashamed of their customers .
but i would point out to the commissioner that there are three readings under co-decision .
commercially speaking , the commission is asking for the adaptation of the treaty to current realities .
we should resist any last minute attempts to reverse that decision .
let us not miss the opportunity .
i found it excellent .
matters we regard as particularly important are improving the working conditions between the weu and the eu and the development of a european security system that is not dependent on the usa .
passing the hat round and trying to move things from pillar to post is not the model way of doing things .
i would even say , without irony , that the problem is so great that we cannot even assess the size exactly .
china , for its part , has expectations to live up to .
this is very fair and indeed this code has been welcomed by the social partners and the committee on employment and social affairs .
anything else would be disreputable . do you not think so , commissioner flynn ?
first of all , recent communications on the information society and the action plan , now in its second version .
but nonetheless that represents a significant step to improve killing trapping methods , including those currently used in the community .
we can use this programme properly to help counter the very powerful forces that are there underneath the surface but will , if unchecked , lead to racism , fascism and nationalism .
the amendment will therefore be accepted with a slight alteration in the wording .
it would also have been vital to specify , secondly , that a foreign policy is appreciated in terms of its effective influence on the ground .
but , faced with these problems , the report does not come up with an answer .
the report contains a good analysis of the ' democratic deficiency ' in the eu .
that is true for mineral oils , it is true for tobacco and it is also true for alcohol .
well , we are already running five minutes late , but i could still hold a roll-call , as mr tomlinson has requested .
the group of the european people 's party supports this report .
madam president , this is a very technical but important report since we are dealing with the question of food safety and hygiene .
in finland , more than two thirds of schools are networked , whereas the corresponding figure for the union as a whole is less than 5 % .
there are criticisms to be made , there are many more things we have to achieve and we have to make it clear that these intergovernmental conferences are perhaps no longer the right method to use .
granted , we are on the wrong course , but in fact the vessel is drifting , engines stopped .
in my own country - austria , which has only recently joined the european union - virtually no one has heard of the ombudsman .
that , of course , is untrue .
we have made that crystal-clear in article 3 .
madam president , mr rothley , you have argued very , very eloquently today in favour of employment , and you have undoubtedly imparted a sense of vision with regard to this entire issue .
legislation needs to be introduced with care , and markets should be established on a reciprocal basis .
i would like to address my remarks to two particular dimensions of the sab , firstly on the consumer health policy unit , and secondly on the transfer of funds for the trademarks agency in alicante .
experience of the ad hoc procedure has been reasonably good to date .
that is not enough of an economic link , it must be greater than that .
however , i must confess to this house that we are late with inspections in other fields which are of enormous importance .
what proposals would he make in the context of the igc in terms of specific policies and measures ?
in my view , however , it does not matter what we call the document which cites the wrongdoers and their wrongdoings .
you have one minute in all and not for each point of order .
i think that that would make sense and i do not know , since i have not yet had the time to read this enormous document , whether that is going to be possible .
i am expressly grateful to the commission for taking an aggressive approach to this subject .
the commission will also accept amendment no 7 .
but i do believe that the commission communication is a start , and we should try to take full advantage of all possibilities within the european union .
he suggested that i said that the court of auditors stopped these contracts .
i myself recommended it to parliament in the 1990 report on that strategy .
all our rural development projects in the philippines are in the poorest parts of the country , seeking specifically to help those who are worst off .
mr macartney has now been made a minister for the social dialogue .
the commission therefore decided that this should be approved before the end of july .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
developments on the lines of those in georgia and armenia are unfortunately not yet visible in tajikistan , which only recently began to introduce economic stabilization measures .
however , ladies and gentlemen , we began our week here with an expression of grief .
it takes away our individuality and our humanity .
' nine thousand banana producers ?
all this has done no more than create further confusion on the matter and has not indicated a clear route for taking a decision at community level .
these things concern all of us .
these have come primarily from russia , often relabelled as being recycled products - russia appears to be contravening the montreal convention - and from china where output is actually growing .
and we have never accepted the extra-territorial principle of the act , which interferes with the trade relations of the european union and its member states with third countries such as cuba .
libel and slander would not fall into this category either - no indictable offence which is punishable by a sentence of up to three years .
there must be a strict limit to what member states can finance via a universal service mechanism .
that is the least one can ask if one wants to talk at all about combatting fraud .
instead of at last taking the necessary steps , however , what does the amsterdam treaty do ?
internal state authorities can also regulate this to whatever extent they think necessary .
in fact the president 's office has already investigated this and agrees with your interpretation .
mr president , i am beginning to get irritated .
i have the bill from the restaurant which i will give to administration .
when will it be realised that it is high time for the use of reason and most certainly not of weapons ?
madam president , general pinochet will cease to be chief head of state of chile in march 1998 .
this is quite a good idea .
this was a matter the commission had discussed within the action plan with canada .
given the importance and sensitivity of the subject , our rapporteur has guided the committee skilfully throughout this period until we were able to reach a conclusion which we were able to adopt with no votes against .
that is a proven fact and has been discussed for years in great detail .
all the creatures of the earth love , suffer , and die as we do .
that must be our primary objective .
therefore , we have to be extremely careful when we analyse them .
the information society forum , in which all these people mentioned by mr theonas work , is quite enthusiastic about the new possibilities .
mr president , i appreciate your being present in madrid on 12 october for our anti-racism match , although of course that is not my point .
fourthly , we should harmonize our skills training , that is to say we must bring this to the level proposed by the commission .
i think we have said a lot about the 20 million unemployed , which is good , but we have said nothing about the 55 million poor people , many of whom actually have jobs .
next year , as budgetary rapporteur , i hope to be able to treat raphael as a true son , and not as a stepson .
i hope that we will , in the field of employment , be won over by the same pressure for convergence which has been ours for the last few years in the field of economic and monetary matters .
but until that occurs , i would like to say three things .
question no 3 by patricia mckenna ( h-0689 / 97 ) :
we support the proposal to set up a separate budget item for special measures for the baltic area .
now a short comment on the declaration itself . i completely agree with the contents .
the slovak president , prime minister and parliament have publicly undertaken to remedy these deficiencies .
people may also have been seriously injured .
indeed , what is important is article 100a , since the purpose of this action is effective and uniform application of the rule of community law , which is a condition of the good functioning of the internal market .
for that reason we are currently negotiating parity agreements with these states on veterinary matters and plant protection , in the form of supplementary agreements to the association agreements .
age is important as well , to avoid speculative transactions spanning this intervention .
besides that the age requirements for trees are difficult to check .
i cannot therefore share the view of some of my colleagues who feel they see in the report an attack on community rights .
afterwards of course , the market will come into its own .
when we look at what the usa and japan are doing , then these are fairly modest demands .
we believe that our amendments contribute something useful .
now , this standardization cannot be obtained directly , because public opinion rejects it .
the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents pursuant to rule 95 of the rules of procedure has been distributed .
however , differences of opinion existed as to when action should commenc , above all regarding objective 2000 .
the pressure of public opinion and the pressure of markets would then have much more effect than the initiation of any breach of contract proceedings by the commission .
but how could he have overlooked you ?
madam president , ladies and gentlemen .
in practical terms this means defining salient points on the basis of which the living standards of women in the poorest countries can be improved by integrating gender issues in development cooperation .
those who say that the available funds are insufficient are right .
perhaps rather , it demonstrates that the treaty does not frighten them .
the european parliament has come out in favour of a tree as the symbol of a growing community and not for three rigid pillars .
the rise in the number of those working part time is especially marked in certain countries , such as the netherlands and great britain , where part time work accounts for 25 % of the whole .
we know from surveys that before 1993 compliance with customs controls was costing traders some ecu 7.5 billion every year - that is based on 1992 trade levels but expressed in today 's money .
mr president , it is my pleasure this evening to welcome this report on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists .
during its five year duration further useful experience will be gained , and this is to find constant reflection in the one year planning .
we were unable to support the report in the vote .
i believe this is the approach we have to take now in planning this , the greatest enlargement - the greatest challenge of our history .
it omits to note that the euro , if it is brought in , will be a new and powerful factor of division between the member states of the wider europe .
it would be helpful if we could support this initiative .
everything they do is basically a step in that direction .
its need cannot seriously be questioned .
we have also signed it and would like that to be recorded please .
it is important to provide these countries with a continued incentive to prepare for a future admission to the european union .
we now hope that through the individual projects we shall gain experience and knowledge which can also be of benefit to others .
is it possible to get a reasonably satisfactory answer to this question ?
it goes without saying , of course , that the commission does not pursue a nuclear policy , in the sense of trying to obtain as many nuclear contracts for industries in the member states .
for instance , the 5 cent coin , at 21.75 mm , is exactly the same size as the 20 cent coin , which makes things extremely difficult for people with disabilities .
we have spared no effort , in particular by clearly stating the progress envisaged in the deepening of our customs union .
in any case , i cannot recommend voting in favour of these two amendments .
then of course there are the well-known objections to this technology , not least in terms of waste .
still we frequently see that american or other delegations handle their work efficiently and better than ours .
according to the commission 's draft regulation , only products with proteins checked and analyzed with the current methods of analysis will necessarily be labelled as genetically modified soya- or maize-based products .
i would like to thank commissioner van de broek and his cabinet colleagues for their assistance in this " liberation ' .
the destruction of a life is always painful , but this was the life of a democratic representative of the people .
because of where i live , i regularly experience the deficiencies of the rail link between madrid and lisbon , and there are other capital cities within the union which could be mentioned as further examples .
it is regrettable that the commission has excluded the social question , despite the fact that some 500 000 jobs have already been lost throughout the european rail industry .
in this way , parliament will not have access to the recommendations of the ecofin council until the morning of 2 may .
this federal europe of the regions destroys nationhood , and is in tune with the wishes of the supporters of the global economy .
i have a very brief question .
we are disturbed by the current deadlock , which is a matter of vital concern to the european union as much as it is to anybody else .
europe is sick .
large differences exist , both between categories of businesses and workers .
support for these areas includes help for the fishing industry , laid down initially in a regulation of 1992 , postponed in 1994 and 1995 and which should have been completed by 31st december 1997 .
i hope you will understand that , in bosnia , we are largely dependent on the cooperation of the authorities .
i should like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur , mr seal , for his account of the evolution of aviation liberalization in the european union .
they are low paid with poor working conditions and their legitimate demand is that they be represented professionally with regard to pay and health and safety conditions .
that to me seems a backward step .
according to the commission , the new objective 2 should only benefit 18 % of the community population .
secondly , as regards the structural funds , there is another problem : the structural funds regulation does not allow for payments to cover natural catastrophes .
it goes without saying that inspectors from the member states can be included in this too .
all that will need to change is what happens anyway with banking institutions : an extra currency needs to be added to the list of currencies that the banking system deals with .
there has been a debate between parliament , the council and the commission about exactly where these lists should be submitted .
the various existing bilateral agreements on investments were to be replaced by a multilateral agreement based on the principles of most-favoured nation treatment and national treatment , which would significantly liberalize investment and provide broadly-based protection for it .
does the commission accept that serial complaints are themselves injurious to the community interest ?
madam president , i would like to confine my remarks to alzheimer 's disease .
the second issue over which there is concern is the issue of delay .
i note that the period since the bangkok summit has also seen much thought being given to questions of process , coordination and vision .
is it going to come to parliament ? 
we will see what we do , but you are well aware that what you have adopted does not provide degressive proportionality . 
finally , the high representative . 
i think you have reached a good agreement , but i think that the president of the council , the high representative and the president of the commission form a package , which we will have to discuss in parliament . 
in summary , mr president , i think that it was paul valéry , who was a great poet and , perhaps therefore a great european , who wrote that a poem is never finished , only abandoned . 
the construction of europe never finishes . 
in this case we have , in the interests of consensus , abandoned some of the advances of the constitutional treaty , but we will be here to keep fighting for them . we will also have supported them in a sentence of the preamble which , ironically , was rescued from the flames : an ever closer union between the peoples of europe . 
that is our objective , mr president . 
( nl ) mr president , the netherlands also shared the sense of relief on saturday morning about the agreement reached , and for this , too , i believe thanks are due to the president - in - office of the council . 
the new treaty enables the european union to progress . 
the union will become more decisive and democratic . 
the european union is back on its feet . 
it can now concentrate fully on its substantive task ; back to work with an agenda ranging from the further development of the social europe to a better - coordinated foreign policy . 
this is also the best way to bring europe closer to its citizens . 
my country , the netherlands , has seen a great deal of discussion about the nature of the treaty that has now been adopted and about its differences from the constitutional treaty the country rejected in a referendum . 
the conclusion was that the differences are such that a second referendum is not necessary . 
the new treaty lacks the constitutional nature of the original constitution ; and so we , too , have no need for a further referendum . 
thus it will just be a case of normal parliamentary ratification . 
the reforms that have been decided on have our wholehearted support , as they make substantial progress - particularly concerning the rights of the european parliament - without fundamentally altering the balance between the member states and the european institutions . 
a larger union needs different , more wide - ranging rules . 
hopefully , all member states will now drive ratification forward , so that we can all get going with the new rules in 2009 , in order to take forward the substantive role of the union in all areas in which our citizens have expectations of us . 
( pl ) mr president , i would like to begin by adding my own voice to the words of profound gratitude for the portuguese presidency . 
considerable success has been achieved . 
the european union needed a way out of the sense of defeat and failure , it needed a political dimension , and thanks to the portuguese presidency , it has one . 
i also consider it to be of exceptional importance that the charter of fundamental rights is an element of those decisions , and i would like to add here that the charter of fundamental rights is the compass , the instrumentarium , of europe . 
i can not even imagine how a country that wishes to be part of the european union could at the same time dissociate itself from that which constitutes its moral , philosophical and political foundation . 
critical words were spoken by my colleague mr duff regarding the position of the british government , which demanded an opt - out . 
i am in a better position . 
the polish government , which asked for an opt - out as the result of a decision taken by the polish people , is leaving power . 
i would like to express the profound hope that following the political change - over that has taken place in my country , and out of loyalty to the polish tradition of solidarity , poland will observe the charter of fundamental rights in full . 
poland will accede to the charter of fundamental rights in full , without any opt - out . 
( fr ) mr president , as spokesperson for the majority french party , the ump , i congratulate the portuguese presidency and i am delighted with this agreement on the text of the treaty . 
it gives the enlarged europe the rules it needs to function effectively and democratically . 
as co-rapporteur on the new composition of the european parliament , i am also pleased about the council 's agreement with the motion for a resolution voted for by parliament on 11 october . 
the council has thereby approved the definition we gave for degressive proportionality , the translation of this principle into figures , the use of eurostat figures to evaluate the populations to be taken into account and the desire to find a more stable system after 2009 . 
the council 's agreement is more than a 100 % agreement ; it is a 101 % agreement , since the council adds a seat to be given to italy , without explaining why . 
this leads me to make two comments . 
the first comment is , as you said , mr president , that all the members of parliament will keep the right to vote - even the president , and even the 73rd italian - contrary to a persistent rumour spread by some of the press . 
my second comment is that the 73rd seat granted to italy departs from the principle of degressive proportionality written into the treaty , proposed by parliament and accepted by the council . 
we must therefore make sure that the decision to apply article 9 a is unassailable before the european court of justice and for this reason the rapporteurs will be proposing a revised draft to parliament taking into account the european council 's wishes . 
sincere thanks to you , too , for the report on the distribution of seats , as well as to mr severin . 
you have done great work here and we have been with you 99 % of the way . 
. - ( fr ) mr president , ' nothing is possible without men ; nothing is lasting without institutions ' . 
so said jean monnet , and it applies very well to our situation . 
is the treaty perfect , then ? 
of course not ! 
jean monnet has an answer for this too . 
on the treaty of rome , he wrote that he did not ask himself whether the treaty could have been better as it corresponded to all that was possible at the time and to the wisdom of the age . 
1957 - 2007 . 
are we taking the risk of starting again ? 
no , of course not . 
there will be no third treaty . 
one crisis is enough . 
two is too many . 
jean monnet again has the answer : ' i have always thought that europe would be made through crises and that it would be the sum of the solutions to those crises . ' 
that is what the treaty is . 
however , obviously not everyone agrees , since our british friends are so keen on opting out . 
i live on a peninsula , so i understand island mentalities . 
however , jean monnet experienced this in 1951 with coal and steel . 
they were not interested , it was offered to them , and then they came on board . 
remember tony blair . 
he signed the social protocol of the maastricht treaty . 
we are sure to find a british colleague to sign the charter of fundamental rights one of these days . 
let us be patient , and remember the chinese diplomat who once said that he admired the wise slowness of the construction of europe . 
let us go on . 
of course , i would like to finish by congratulating the portuguese presidency , and as i am a french mep , i am proud of my portuguese president and the circumstances that mean we now seem to have two for the price of one ! 
( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , at one blow the european union has disengaged itself from its constitutional impasse . 
the new european union will be more capable of action , more democratic and more transparent and it will be in a position to discharge its duties more successfully both at home and throughout the world . 
this is good , and congratulations to the portuguese presidency in this regard . 
if i mention with pride that the german council presidency was there at the beginning of the road to lisbon , i hope you will not mind my saying so , as a german . 
not all the problems have been solved yet . 
the absurd episode surrounding the 751st seat mandate and the president 's voting rights made this clear . 
there should be no question at all of the council not being authorised to remove an elected member 's right to vote - irrespective of position . 
i am grateful that both the president as well as parliament 's representatives at the intergovernmental conference have quickly and palpably made this clear . 
nevertheless , there is a problem here . 
it concerns parliament 's composition , which remains unclear as from 2014 . 
i am convinced that it will involve finding a system that defines and governs parliament 's composition according to objective criteria , irrespective of political caprice . 
it can not be true that the council effectively distributes parliament 's seats as if it were lord of the manor . 
we have to strive towards this until 2014 . 
one important advance has not perhaps been recognised sufficiently to date : the strengthening of the principle of subsidiarity . 
this is a very important step in involving national parliaments in responsibility for european legislation as far as subsidiarity is concerned . 
subsidiarity and the demand for it strengthen the community and do not weaken it , commission president . 
we shall also be striving for this in the future . 
i can merely ask the national parliaments to make thorough use of these new opportunities ! 
( applause ) 
mr president , i , too , welcome this agreement , which , despite a few oddities like the extra seat for italy , is a good package that deserves ratification and will make the european union function better , while also improving its democratic accountability . 
let me dwell for my remaining minute on the second aspect . 
mr kirkhope asked just now whether we have answered the questions posed at laeken about making the eu more democratically accountable and closer to its citizens . 
i would say that we have certainly moved in that direction . 
let us remember one thing : once this treaty comes into force , no european legislation can be adopted without , firstly , prior examination by every national parliament , secondly , the approval of the council of ministers composed of national ministers accountable to those very same national parliaments and , thirdly , approval by this european parliament , with its members directly chosen by citizens specifically to deal with european issues at european level . 
that is a level of accountability that exists in no other international structure . look at the world trade organisation . 
look at the imf . look at the world bank . 
look at the oecd . you name it , nothing above the level of the nation state has that level of democratic accountability . 
those who are really worried about democratic accountability in international structures should focus on those institutions and organisations . 
we should be proud of what we are achieving in our democratic european union . 
( pl ) mr president , we do indeed have a new treaty , and this alone is cause for satisfaction . 
there is , however , something else that is more important - that the treaty is a good one . 
it is a good treaty , because it responds to the challenges that europe is facing today . 
moreover , it also fulfils the aims that were stated as an obligation in the laeken declaration six years ago . 
in line with those aims , the treaty arranges and simplifies both the institutional framework and the legal system of the union . 
it democratises the european union , among other things by reinforcing the legislative role of our parliament . 
it brings the union closer to its citizens , and one way in which it does this is through the citizens ' initiative . 
the question is , will the union , as a result of the treaty , have greater significance in the world and act more effectively ? 
this , however , does not depend only on the institutions introduced or modified by the treaty ; it depends primarily on the political will of the leaders of the member states . 
should this will be lacking , all the institutional reform will have counted for nothing . 
in order that the treaty does not remain a moribund law , a moribund document , i would like to appeal for a community of political will at the time of its signing and after its ratification . 
mr president , the text of the reform treaty agreed at the lisbon summit is clear progress , a step forward in the history of european integration - i would like to call it european unification . 
therefore , it should be greeted with satisfaction . 
nonetheless , however important this step might be , it is not the last one . 
in the short term it is crucial to see the treaty ratified by all the 27 member states . 
it should now be clear to everybody that there was no plan b and there is no plan c. after ratification we must continue , in the medium and long term , with the necessary reforms and policies until a complete reconciliation between europe 's history and geography is achieved within the framework of european transnational democracy . 
in this moment of relief , it is also crucial to get rid of any democratic hypocrisy and demagogy and admit that , in this complex world , political management requires - more than ever - a professional competence which could not be the subject of referendums . 
we must ask the people to decide , by ' yes ' or ' no ' , on principles and fundamentals , not on sophisticated technicalities and complicated compromises . 
for the rest , we must observe the principle of the non-imperative mandate . 
on the other hand , we must also admit that the progress we are celebrating today was achieved at the expense of transparency and sincerity . 
the gap between peoples and us , the political leaders , after lisbon remains at least as big as before . 
until we close this gap , we should keep the bottles of champagne unopened . 
( cs ) mr president , as a former member of the convention on the future of europe , as the only national parliamentarian involved in the negotiations and as a convinced opponent of the constitution since the very beginning i am glad to say that in lisbon common sense has prevailed , at least to some extent . 
the very concept of a european constitution was erroneous from the beginning . 
i am glad that it has been abandoned and i am glad that my country was among those who contributed to this . 
the eu is not a state , it will never be one and therefore it can not have a constitution . 
it has to be built on an intergovernmental treaty , whereby the member states , the national states , remain the corner stones of the whole process of european integration . 
with regards to the content , each of us likes and dislikes certain aspects of it . 
on the one hand , i am personally delighted with the reinforcement of the role of the national parliaments and the national executives through the so - called flexibility clause . 
what i do not like , on the other hand , is a reduction of the national right of veto . 
however , being a realist i am aware that we have reached the limits of what is possible . 
what i see as important , nonetheless , is the fact that for the very first time in history of the eu an artificial concept elaborated at the green table had to some extent to be reworked after being tested against reality . 
this leads me to hope that the eu will continue in the future to demonstrate that it can move away from certain concepts that prove to be unfit , such as , in my opinion , the 50 - year - old obsolete federalist model . 
it leads me to hope that the eu will be able to move towards a genuine , flexible , decentralised intergovernmental organisation capable of coping with the challenges of the 21st century . 
mr president , i trust , however , that parliament will not succumb to the temptation to revive the already dead constitutional idea , because it would merely illustrate that it is an ivory tower . 
( pl ) mr president , i did not think the last week would end so successfully . 
firstly , at the lisbon summit we adopted a new reform treaty , which is an enormous success , and i warmly congratulate prime minister josé sócrates , president barroso and indeed all of us . 
it went off without any attempts to veto it or any additional battles over its final form . 
in my view that means that the european union has emerged from its institutional crisis . 
secondly , there is good news from my country , where the removal from power in recent days of an anti-european and far - right government is an undeniable success . 
the position of the polish people is confirmation of what i have said many times - most poles support european integration ; poles want poland to be a partner , not an opponent , of the european union . 
such events undeniably instil optimism about the future of our common european project . 
i believe that the european union is ready to meet the challenges of the future and , as mr sócrates correctly observed , the european union is now a stronger and more internally cohesive structure , as well as being a decidedly more powerful partner in negotiations in international global relations . 
the positions of the president - in - office of the council and the high representative for the common foreign and security policy are a potent weapon which , if competently deployed , may positively strengthen the image of the european union . 
one of the most important achievements of this agreement , moreover , is that the charter of fundamental rights has acquired a legally binding character . 
i hope that the new polish government will withdraw the decision to exclude polish citizens from the provisions of chapter iv of the charter , entitled solidarity . 
this chapter contains provisions relating to employee and trade union rights that are particularly dear to the polish and european left . 
mr president , i would like to congratulate the portuguese presidency on an excellent result under the circumstances . 
but there is one thing we need to keep in mind : the fundamental objective of the convention on the future of europe is still to be accomplished , that is , to overcome the gap between institutions and european citizens . 
we now have the means to apply our common european policies . 
what we need is political will and determination . 
everything now centres on implementation , and there are two principles on which our implementation of this lisbon treaty should be based : firstly , subsidiarity . 
defining the competences of the eu is clearly a very encouraging achievement , linked with the increased role and responsibility of the national parliaments , because our citizens should perceive that the european community will address the problems of the community efficiently and , at the same time , abstain from intervening in their lives where it is not necessary . 
the second principle concerns solidarity , which is a core value of the european community . 
agreeing on degressive proportionality in forming the future european parliament is a clear expression of that solidarity , and i am grateful for it . 
another very important test of this solidarity will be creating the common foreign policy on energy security , as proposed last month by the european parliament , including a special high representative on energy serving under the new high representative for foreign affairs . 
lastly , i would quote one fine expression of solidarity when president barroso told his russian counterpart last may in samara that , in the eu 's understanding of solidarity , poland and estonia are as important as germany and portugal . 
( pl ) mr president , following the lisbon summit , the discussion of the european treaty may be considered to be closed , as we now have one supreme aim - to ratify the treaty as quickly and as efficiently as possible . 
parliament does have a role to play here : please bear in mind that we have greater importance under the treaty than we had before . 
there are three points to consider : the description of the role and tasks of the high representative for the common foreign and security policy and the matter of his election , this being a joint decision with the european council from 1 january 2009 . 
we need to prepare for this joint decision in several areas , primarily security and the administration of justice . 
thirdly , we must hold a political debate to finalise the principles by which the president of the european council will act , with particular reference to his relations with the european parliament . 
the most important thing , though , is ratification , and it depends to a large extent on us members of the european parliament . 
it will take place in different ways in each country . 
we must find ways of persuading citizens that this is a success not just for the union , not just for politicians , but above all for them . 
this is our main task - ratification . 
thanks and congratulations . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank you for the excellent debate we have had on the summit and the lisbon treaty . 
firstly , say what you like about this new treaty , but one thing no one can deny is that europe is stronger as a result of this treaty . 
this treaty affirms european values , the good values that were always the foundation of the european integration project . 
this treaty boosts the european economy and creates the conditions for europe better to play its role in the world . 
as many have observed , this is a treaty that makes the european institutions and the political workings of europe more democratic . 
this treaty equips the european union of 27 for more effective decision - making . 
those who like democracy also like democracy to be appreciated as a method that allows effective decision - making , and all those who follow european political life understand that europe needed more effective decision - making . 
finally , i would like to say to anyone who has doubts about the treaty and europe 's capability , please wake up to reality ; the world has already reached its conclusion on the treaty . 
europe has become stronger , better able to respond to global challenges , better able to respond to strategic challenges , and since lisbon the world has been looking to europe in the hope that it will once again take up its role in the world . 
no , this treaty means progress for us . 
other people have already said it about europe : no , do not doubt ; wake up , we are stronger . 
europe is more confident since the lisbon agreement and europe is now in a position to take a stance on the future ; it can move from the defensive to the offensive . 
graham watson was kind enough to mention pessoa in his speech . 
i would like to thank him very much for this personal kindness , as pessoa is one of our great poets and i would like to quote pessoa again : he once spoke about ' a nostalgia for the future ' . 
i too , as a european , am nostalgic for the future and i am nostalgic for the time when europe discussed the future , showed leadership , and i am nostalgic for those days and i believe that this treaty provides the conditions to enable europe to do that . 

if you will allow me , mr president , i would like to clarify two things : the first is about the president of parliament , to tell members that it never entered anybody 's head that the council might propose that the president of parliament should lose the right to vote . 
the president will of course retain that right ; i do not know how this mistaken idea arose , but what the council decided is that this parliament will have 751 members ( 750 plus the president ) . 
next i would like to say that the ioannina clause has been resolved , as i always said it would be . 
ioannina must be legally binding , but should not be in the treaty , and the solution we came up with of a declaration plus a protocol is fully in line with the mandate we were given . 
i too would like to praise the previous presidency , as i have always done and always do in the same way . 
throughout the whole process of this treaty there were two decisive moments . 
the first came last october when angela merkel decided to make the treaty the main issue of her presidency and of future presidencies . 
this move required political courage and was a political risk . 
at the time no one thought it had much chance of success . 
i call this a decisive moment because europe needed to get back to politics and also to get back to courage and political risk . 
the other decisive moment , as i said earlier , was when we decided , taking the opportunity of the last council , to reach agreement in october rather than leave it for december . 
finally , mr president , i would like to finish by saying that certainly many people , and many people in europe , who never believed in europe are as dissatisfied with this treaty as they would be with any other treaty . 
however , perhaps there are some who would like a different treaty and with them it is worth having a dialogue , to tell them that at this point the alternative was either to have this treaty or to remain in a state of institutional crisis . 
i think that all who realise that a politician has to deal with reality rather than with fantasy will support what was decided in lisbon . 
as for ratification , i would like to be clear that it is the business of each country . 
however , what i can not accept as a democrat is for those who argue for national referendums to do so by trying to diminish representative democracy , challenging the legitimacy of parliamentary ratification . 
( applause ) 
i am a democrat and europe is democratic , and being democrats we leave each country free to decide the best method of ratification . 

finally , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , yes , i am very proud , yes i am very satisfied , yes , i feel very honoured to have been part , along with many others , of a historic and decisive moment , the moment in which the lisbon treaty was born , because it means that europe will move forward . 
( loud applause ) 
president - in - office , i should also like to say a sincere word of thanks specifically to the minister of foreign affairs , luís amado , to manuel lobo antunes , as well as to ambassador mendonça e moura and the legal service coordinated by jean - claude pires . 
president of the commission . - mr president , ms thyssen asked a specific question : can we make progress between now and the final ratification ? 
as i said , it is by delivering results to european citizens that we can help to create the right political environment to facilitate ratification . 
it would be a mistake to slow down our delivery , and it would be against the twin - track strategy central to the commission , which stated that we should at the same time solve the political institutional matters and deliver concrete results to our citizens . 
on the contrary , this commission , and i am sure also this parliament , should be active - and we could be even more active together - in promoting a european citizens ' agenda . 
the second issue concerned communication and democracy . 
communicating about a treaty and explaining it to our public is primarily the responsibility of the national authorities . 
however , it is also a task for the european institutions . 
i agree with what mr queiró said about the importance of the role of the european parliament in this matter . 
we in the commission are ready to assume our responsibility in close cooperation with member states and the european parliament . 
i agree with the points made about subsidiarity by mr kelam and mr nassauer . 
it is very important to highlight the added value , in terms of democracy , of this treaty . 
it makes europe more democratic and more accountable and places a stronger emphasis on subsidiarity . 
subsidiarity is a way to reinforce europe and the european institutions , not to weaken those institutions , because by working close to the citizens they get more legitimacy and can take better decisions . 
i also believe that it is right in our communication , as mr corbett highlighted , to explain the new democratic dimension . 
we in the european union are proud to have this kind of democratic system . 
we can always make it better , but there is no other place in the world where there is such democratic participation at transnational level as the european union . 
we should also , in communication terms , make clear our reinforced capacity to act on behalf of the citizens in areas relevant to their concerns , like climate protection , energy and migration . 
those are concrete concerns for our citizens and we are addressing those concerns . 
in communication terms , we should also highlight the reinforced capacity to act in the international scene . 
finally , i want to highlight one point that was made clear by mr poignant and i thank him for highlighting the importance of jean monnet . 
it is true that this is not a perfect treaty , but sometimes people say we are giving up the values and the commitment of the founding fathers . 
that is not true . 
we are doing what jean monnet and many others have said , which is to build pas à pas - step by step - this common project , and we have to do it by conceding now that we have to commit to our citizens , and that we have to fulfil concrete tasks and deliver concrete results . 
the lisbon summit , in concentrating on the treaty and the institutions and , on the second day , showing the way to globalisation , and the way we can together reinforce our capacity to act so that we can meet the challenge of globalisation , has indeed set the agenda for the future of europe . 
it was therefore a great success , and the portuguese presidency , the member states , the european parliament and the commission should really celebrate this fact and look to the future with renewed confidence . 
( applause ) 
many thanks , commission president . 
this debate has shown that we can believe in the future of our continent of europe . 
we shall be even more committed in working towards it . 
many thanks . 
the debate is closed . 
written declarations ( article 142 ) 
in writing . - ( fr ) my first words will be to congratulate the leaders of the member states for the historic agreement they entered into in lisbon , which brings to an end many years of institutional uncertainty . 
i welcome the relentless work of daring , wisdom and pragmatism of the french president nicolas sarkozy , and angela merkel 's excellent german presidency in the first half of 2007 of which put the institutional agenda on the rails . 
i would like to include in these congratulations recognition of the excellent and immense work accomplished by chairman valéry giscard d'estaing . 
this agreement picks up the major political advances of the old text : a stable presidency for the european union , a person responsible for european diplomacy , and a new voting mechanism with the extension of qualified majority voting , while strengthening the powers of the european parliament . 
i am sorry that the symbols of the european union ( the flag , anthem and motto ) have been abandoned . 
this treaty also takes account of the messages delivered by the french and dutch people who rejected the old treaty , in that it does not retain the character of a constitution , which the original text had , and it does not set in stone in the treaties of the european union a collection of european public policies that instead come under the current functioning of european democracy . 
in writing . - ( hu ) i consider it to be a major step that the politicians who were present in lisbon , conscious of their responsibility and setting aside their historical grievances , have reached agreement on a treaty that has taken six long years to produce , and which will determine the future face of europe and establish a framework enabling it to function efficiently . 
it is important that the process of ratifying this document , due to be signed on 13 december this year , also goes without a hitch in the member states . 
it is vital that the european parliament should continue to pledge its support for the reform treaty , and here again we draw member states ' attention to the importance of the ratification process . 
hungary has always firmly supported the constitutional process and believed that sooner or later the member states would find a common voice and succeed in moving the process of european integration forward . 
as a member of the european parliament 's committee on foreign affairs , i believe it is important to emphasise that the document that has been adopted can contribute positively to making european union foreign policy more effective , and can also enhance its effectiveness in the international diplomatic arena . 
it is not only in the realm of foreign policy , however , that the reform treaty may be expected to bring about change , but also on numerous other issues that are vital for the efficient functioning of the eu . 
for example , it opens up the possibility that the new european parliament and european commission that will be constituted in 2009 will be able to commence operations on a more efficient , more transparent and more democratic basis . 
this joint success first and foremost required the political will to take joint action , so let us now rejoice in the treaty , but in the interests of ensuring the success of the process we must not stop here ; we must continue in our joint efforts to ensure that the ratification process is brought to a successful conclusion . 
in order to reach agreement on the reform treaty , too many gifts were handed out behind closed doors in lisbon : italy receives an extra seat in the european parliament and bulgaria the cyrillic ' evro ' , poland can continue to block the decision - making process for a number of years to come , and austria can exclude german students from its universities . 
this horse trading is medieval and runs counter to our endeavours towards greater transparency in the union . 
nevertheless , we can be pleased that at long last , following years of debate , we have reached an agreement full stop , as this treaty is an improvement on the current situation . 
it is not the most elegant of agreements , but it does ensure more democracy in europe . 
it gives the european parliament and national parliaments more influence , enabling european citizens to exert more direct influence on policy . 
it meets the need for common energy and foreign policies . 
rigorous enforcement of the copenhagen criteria is a necessity , and finally more democratic accountability is also afforded by the introduction of the ' orange card ' , which gives national parliaments the opportunity of contesting european legislation on grounds of subsidiarity . 
the truth about the reform treaty is the same as that about the european constitution . 
these deeds transform the international organisation that is the european community , as well as the union between its members that is the european union , into a continental superstate . 
they also effect a recognition of this superstate ( by accession to the european convention on human rights of 1950 , the parties to which may only be states ) . 
they open up a new path for the creation of a single european law without the involvement of the member states ( through interpretation of the charter of fundamental rights by the european court of justice ) . 
one could spend a long time listing examples of equivalent significance . 
in view of this situation , we come up against the issue of guarantees of the rights of the peoples of europe in the new superstate , since it has so far been the member states that constituted these guarantees for their peoples . 
this problem has not been addressed at all in the reform treaty . 
since the rights of peoples are none other than human rights raised to the level of community life , because of the project to establish a superstate we are facing a human rights crisis in europe . 
we must therefore reject the reform treaty and set about doing some fundamental work on a system to guarantee the rights of peoples under the conditions of european integration . 
if we do not do this , europe will be threatened by another explosion of totalitarianism . 
agenda 
ladies and gentlemen , with the agreement of the political groups , and in accordance with our rules of procedure , i propose the following amendments to the agenda for the current part - session . 
firstly , i propose that the vote on the motions for resolutions tabled to close the debate on the eu - russia summit be moved to the next part - session in brussels . 
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , i rise on a point of order under rule 166 , and with reference to rules 45 , 77 , 89 , 113 and 155 . 
we took a decision yesterday that we would have a resolution on the eu - russia summit this week , and my group believes that we should stick to that . 
i know there is an attempt to try to revote that decision , but i hope the house will sensibly see off such a narrow - minded approach to politics . 
( applause ) 
are there any other comments ? 
on behalf of the pse group . - ( de ) mr president , this now also concerns fellow members . 
we were not informed about this application . 
there was a communication problem here yesterday . 
neither the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats nor my group were informed of this request . 
this is also the reason why we have been feeling relatively overlooked and have abstained from voting . 
we have both - that is , my fellow member , mr daul , and i - put forward the proposal this morning that we flesh out this resolution with care . 
we note the desire for a resolution and accept it on condition that we flesh it out with care . 
after the summit we shall also have all the information available , hence the deferral of the proposal until after the summit . 
on behalf of the verts / ale group . - ( de ) mr president , i do not know how strong communications are within the large groups . 
we have always said that we want a resolution - the general secretaries have been informed of this . 
we have said that if you speak out against this , we shall do so at the vote on monday morning , as is our right . 
we have always said so and if this has not been relayed to you , it is not our problem , but yours . 
as regards the content : a new law against extremists , for example , has been adopted in russia in recent weeks that clearly restricts freedom of the press and freedom of opinion . 
we therefore want the resolution to be adopted before the summit to enable the eu to state our position on the situation in russia through this resolution . 
we shall still be able to draw up a resolution on the results after the summit , but this parliament , which wants to be political , should also adopt political freedom of expression by a majority before the summit in order to show mainland russia what we think about freedom and democracy here in the european parliament . 
( applause ) 
( de ) mr president , we would all certainly go along with this . 
mr cohn - bendit has stated precisely what we are all thinking . 
however , in this house there are rules of procedure , not just because we want to torment people , but because large groups with way over 200 members also have problems , which you have perhaps to a lesser extent , mr cohn - bendit , in your smaller group , namely that we have to be able to consult one another . 
when i add the members of the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats and those of my group together , there are way over 450 members in this house who need a little time for consultation . 
i would therefore make the following proposal : what mr cohn - bendit has said here , that we convey to the russian side that we consider this law unfair and that it should be retracted , the commission and the council can pick up from here on . 
this is certainly a statement of the will of the entire european parliament , which has already been made clear through this discussion . 
a resolution , however , that contains 60 - 70 items also has to be able to be discussed a little and only by doing so will it work . 
we therefore ask for the debate , the draft resolution , and then the vote at the next sitting . 
this is in actual fact a fair compromise . 
please endorse it ! 
ladies and gentlemen , according to our rules of procedure , the point that mr watson has raised is correct and is well established in the rules of procedure . 
it is evident , however , that there is a difference of opinion on this issue . 
in accordance with the rules of procedure , we are going to resolve this issue in the only way that we can , which is on the basis that parliament is sovereign . 
we are therefore going to have two votes : the first vote will be to vote on whether you want to vote on this matter . 
if the result of this vote is negative , we will leave the agenda as it is and there will be no amendments . 
if you decide that you do want to vote , we will then vote on the item , as to whether or not the vote on the motions for resolutions will be postponed . 
i therefore put to the vote the question of whether parliament wishes to vote on this matter . 
( parliament decided to vote on the matter ) 
consequently , i now put to the vote the proposal that i presented to you , that is , to move the vote on the motions for resolutions on the eu - russia summit to the next part - session in brussels . 
those who vote in favour will be voting in favour of moving this vote to the next part - session and those who vote against will be voting in favour of keeping the agenda as it is . 
( parliament approved the proposal ) 
secondly , i propose that the following two reports , currently entered with debate on thursday between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. , be entered directly in the votes on thursday at 12 noon : 
the report by margie sudre , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the amended proposal for a council regulation on the conclusion of the fisheries partnership agreement between the european community and the republic of madagascar - c6 - 0064/2007 - , and 
the report by emanuel jardim fernandes , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the proposal for a council regulation on the conclusion of the fisheries partnership agreement between the european community and the republic of mozambique - c6 - 0284/2007 - . 
if there are no comments , we shall include these votes directly on thursday in the voting time at 12 noon . 
mr president , i rise on a point of order on the same legal basis as mr watson . 
i merely wish to point out that we have had a very important debate about the increase of democracy within the eu . 
this tactic , which has , apparently , just been successful , demonstrates that democracy , even within this parliament , needs to be extended further . 
i can say - as a member of a large group , the ppe - de group , of which i am extremely proud to be a member - that the blame for not holding a resolution was put on other groups . 
i then found out that this was an agreement by the two large groups . 
quite clearly , this is an unsatisfactory way to proceed . 
i accept the decision . my practical recommendation to you , mr president , would be to ensure that the full verbatim account of the debate on the eu - russia summit be presented by the president - in - office of the council and the president of the commission to president putin at the summit - not afterwards . 
( applause ) 
- ( fr ) mr president , regarding the entry of the reports on fishing , i do not know if it was an interpreting error , but you said that it would be with debate , and was on the agenda for thursday morning . 
it will be without debate . 
so i think it was an interpreting error . 
ladies and gentlemen , we propose that they be entered directly in the voting time on thursday at 12 noon . 
they are currently entered with debate on thursday between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. 
we therefore propose that they be entered in the votes on thursday at 12 noon , without debate . 
( parliament approved the proposal ) 
1 . ec - chile association agreement ( accession of bulgaria and romania ) ( vote ) 
- recommendation : helmuth markov ( a6 -0361-2007 ) 
2 . ec - swiss confederation agreement on scientific and technical cooperation ( vote ) 
- report : angelika niebler 
3 . community plant variety rights ( vote ) 
- report : neil parish ( a6 -0373-2007 ) 
4 . nuclear energy ( ratification by slovenia of the protocol amending the paris convention ) ( vote ) 
- recommendation : giuseppe gargani ( a6 -0369-2007 ) 
5 . un / ece espoo convention ( vote ) 
- report : miroslav ouzký ( a6 -0395-2007 ) 
6 . convention on the protection of the european communities ' financial interests ( vote ) 
- report : jean - marie cavada ( a6 -0360-2007 ) 
7 . communication infrastructure for the schengen information system environment ( decision ) ( vote ) 
- report : carlos coelho ( a6 -0357-2007 ) 
- before the vote : 
rapporteur . - ( pt ) mr president , as we are running late , just three brief comments : firstly , parliament regrets the delay in sis ii ; secondly parliament is facing an emergency situation because if we do not decide now , the member states may have to re-establish internal borders , which is unacceptable ; thirdly , parliament prefers the technical solution of extending the agreement with sisnet and regards the alternative solution of the agreement with s - testa to be a financially damaging solution , but unfortunately we have to keep both on the table to prevent the raising of borders that no one wants . 
8 . mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund ( vote ) 
- report : reimer böge 
9 . framework directive on the sustainable use of pesticides ( vote ) 
- report : christa klaß ( a6 -0347-2007 ) 
- before the vote : 
mr president , i rise on a point of order under rule 166 , to invoke rule 37 ( 1 ) of our rules of procedure . 
rule 37 ( 1 ) concerns the access to documents and provision of information to this parliament . 
in the run - up to this vote on pesticides , many , if not all , in this house have been bombarded by e-mails asking us to vote for amendments that go even further than the commission would like us to . 
these e-mails come from an organisation called pesticide watch , whose constituent organisations received large amounts of funding from the european commission - indeed , part of the eur 11.7 million spent in the last two years under the budget line relating to the community action programme promoting non-governmental organisations ( ngos ) primarily active in the field of environmental protection and the life + programme . 
under rule 37 ( 1 ) , can i ask for the various exchanges between the commission and these ngos , who have been lobbying us on all these matters ? 
this payroll lobbying has certainly led to an increase in the number of e-mails being received by meps , but surely it is wrong for one commission dg to use large sums of taxpayers ' money , and abuse the role of ngos , to try and change the views of parliamentarians and the lead commission dg on this matter . 
( loud applause from the right ) 
mr heaton - harris , we will pass on your comment . 
10 . the placing of plant protection products on the market ( vote ) 
- report : hiltrud breyer 
- after the vote on amendment 243 : 
mr president , on a point of order , this is a complete fiasco and we must go to full electronic voting . 
this is bloody ridiculous ! 
( applause ) 
mr booth , this is not a fiasco . 
there have been errors which are statistically normal in a vote of this length . 
what are ridiculous are interventions such as yours . 
( applause ) 
- before the vote on the legislative resolution : 

mr president , on a point of order , i do not want to prolong things , and you are too polite to say so , but there is a rule which allows the president taking a vote , when presented with a vote of this length - eight pages of thirty separate votes - to put it to the house that the report be sent back to the committee to be sifted and re-presented . 
i think we should apply that rule more often . 
( applause ) 
on behalf of the pse group . - ( de ) mr president , you have done a very good job and earned a good lunch , as have we . 
we should postpone the vote until tomorrow . 
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - ( fr ) mr president , it is 2 p.m. , we should stop the vote . 
i am sorry , really sorry that a report like this should reach plenary . 
i propose that next time more work is done on it in committee and that in future , in the plan to reform parliament , these rules are reviewed . 
we can not go on working like this . 
( applause ) 
( fr ) mr president , i think what my fellow member said is quite right , but he should have admitted that it was his group that did not respect the work in committee and tabled all the amendments here today . 
( applause ) 
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , on this point , according to mr cohn - bendit , the committee decided by a very clear majority , yet the chamber has laboured against this decision in a way that borders on obstructionism . 
this is the truth of the situation . 
therefore , it is not a procedural issue , but a question of political attitude . 
ladies and gentlemen , there has been a combination of two unfortunate circumstances . 
firstly , we had a very long prior debate , which delayed the voting time , and secondly today we have had one of the largest votes in this session . 
we are therefore going to suspend voting at this stage and i thank you for your cooperation . 
voting time 
the next item is the vote . 
( for the results and other details on the vote : see minutes ) 
explanations of vote 
in writing . - ( pt ) this convention - which aims to set out the obligations of the parties to assess the environmental impact of certain activities at an early stage of planning and imposes on states the general obligation regarding notification and consultation on all major projects that are likely to have a significant adverse environmental impact across borders - was signed by the community and its member states on 26 february 1991 and approved by the community on 27 june 1997 . 
parliament approved some amendments , notably one extending the definition of the ' public ' in article 1 ( x ) of the convention to clarify that the public that may participate in procedures under the convention includes civil society and , in particular , non-governmental organisations , and one that opens the convention for accession by non-ece member countries upon approval by the meeting of the parties , which deserves our support . 
the other amendments seem less important to us . in principle , i do not believe they create any problems . 
we therefore agreed with the rapporteur and voted in favour of the report . 
in writing . - ( el ) the brief report contains serious gaps , which play down the importance of the issue . 
the legislative regulations governing the protection of the environment are a compromise between the need to protect it and the demands of big business to maximize its excessive profits come what may . 
preoccupation with profit makes the competitiveness of the eu 's multinationals a priority above all the others . 
the following are symptomatic of this : 
i. the kyoto protocol , in which trade in pollutants is prominent ; 
ii . the entire legislative framework , which facilitates the use and expansion of gmos ; 
iii . legislation on the monitoring of the use of chemical substances in consumer products to a permissible level . 
this legislation took as many as 40 years to be completed , although it naturally has many exceptions , from 1967 ( directive 67 / 458 / εec ) to 2007 , when the reach regulation entered into force ; 
iv . a still highly deficient legislative framework for the integrated management of radioactive waste ; 
v. the distorting development of biofuels , at the expense of food crops . 
multinationals are nonetheless allowed to act anti-environmentally . 
all they suffer are some fines , which represent a very small part of the additional profits coming from the destruction of the environment . 
this proves the adage that he who pays the piper calls the tune . 
we believe that these are serious omissions . 
what is required is a brief but very meaningful and useful reference to these issues . 
in writing . - ( pt ) the convention on the protection of the european communities ' financial interests and its protocols are on the list of conventions and protocols in the field of justice and home affairs contained in annex i to the act of accession . 
this convention and its protocols were adopted in 1996 , with the aim of establishing a common base for the criminal - law protection of the ec 's financial interests , and entered into force in 2002 following ratification by the then 15 member states . 
in order to avoid wasting time and effort on the laborious negotiation , conclusion and ratification ( by 27 member states ) of specific accession protocols to each convention , the act of accession of romania and bulgaria introduced a simplified system for the accession to the conventions and protocols concluded by the member states on the basis of article 34 of the treaty on european union or article 293 of the ec treaty . 
i therefore support this proposal for a council decision which simplifies the determination of the date of entry into force of this convention in relation to romania and bulgaria . 
i would like to speak about the package of two documents - the commission proposal and the council decision on the development of the schengen information system infrastructure and its implementation and management . 
i voted in favour of both resolutions and consider them to be very important eu legislative documents . 
it is a shame that the launch of sis ii keeps being postponed . 
we are so far behind schedule that it is essential to find a way out of the situation that would enable us to use the sis 1 + network after 13 november 2008 , i.e. to extend the service provided by the sisnet network and to create a fall - back solution with the s - testa network . 
it is now clear that the human and financial resources allocated for the implementation of sis ii will have to be shared between the three projects being developed simultaneously : sis ii , sisone4all and the installation , operation and management of a communication infrastructure . 
this will have a negative impact on the implementation of sis ii . 
this is why the decision on the financing of sis 1 + and subsequently sisone4all will be of great importance : will it be financed by all participating parties or will sisnet , for example , receive funding from the eu budget ? 
the correct distribution of eu and member states ' resources will be of great significance . 
however , in view of the project 's importance as regards the security of the eu , it is obvious that sis ii is the greatest priority . 
we must allocate funds for eu security and the development of communications infrastructure . 
in writing . - ( ro ) only one year after its establishment , in 2006 , the european globalisation adjustment fund is already requested . 
i welcome the voting of the decision to mobilize the fund , which represents a first attempt to support our european citizens who face the challenges of globalisation . 
globalisation is a phenomenon that offers us numerous chances and opportunities , but also generates difficulties of adjustment to its consequences . 
therefore , it is very important for the european union to be capable not only of responding to such challenges , but also to approach them efficiently by fast mobilization of the necessary financial instruments . 
european citizens ' safety and confidence in the future lie at the basis of our actions and initiatives . 
i am very pleased to welcome the orientation of this fund toward the field of labour and labour safety , but i also emphasize the importance of education in this field and the need to take into consideration this area , as well , in the future fund mobilizations . 
at the end , i hope that in the future , in case of need , each eu member state will benefit from the mobilization of the european globalisation adjustment fund , whose less positive effects affect us all , including in the new member states . 
this is the only way in which we will be able to build true sustainable development over the entire eu territory . 
in writing . - i voted in favour of this first ever mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund . 
the fund was set up , following a successful campaign by the pse group , to alleviate the effects of globalisation on european workers . 
in this instance , the fund is being used to assist approximately 900 workers made redundant in the automobile sector in france . 
in writing . - ( pt ) in march 2007 , france requested the mobilisation of the egf in respect of the redundancies of 1 345 workers of renault sa and 1 057 workers of peugeot sa and their suppliers . 
owing to the budgetary restrictions on this fund ( eur 500 million a year ) , its restrictive eligibility criteria and the number of workers affected , the amount of the community contribution awarded was eur 3 816 280 . 
thus we can see that this comes to eur 1 902 for each of the renault - linked workers made redundant and eur 1 190 for each of the peugeot - linked workers made redundant . 
the european commission estimated that between 35 000 and 50 000 workers could benefit from this fund , but eu data indicate that the number of workers made redundant as a result of ' restructuring ' is far in excess of half a million . 
the situation is all the more serious as most of these workers were made redundant as a result of ' restructuring ' regarded as ' within ' the eu , and therefore not covered by the fund 's eligibility criteria . 
what is in fact required is an end to the policy of liberalisation and maximising profit that is the cause of relocations and " restructuring ” , and measures to preserve jobs . 
the european globalisation adjustment fund came into being in 2006 under the considerable influence of the defeat of the constitutional referendum in france . 
right from the start the impression was created that this was a compensation formula , linked more to the exaggerated problem of the ' delocalisation ' of jobs to new member states than to the problem of globalisation . 
as such , the fund is a response to the fears associated with the enlargement of the european union , essentially reinforcing them and blocking the benefits arising from the uniting of europe in 2004 for new and old member states . 
it is no surprise that we are starting with an application from france , linked to the difficulties experienced by peugeot and renault suppliers , for a sum of eur 3.8 million . 
the application is properly grounded and has received full support from the european parliament 's committee on budgets . 
i hope that the european globalisation adjustment fund will not become a method of typical rent - seeking , in other words an easy method of obtaining eu subsidies for businesses that are experiencing difficulties , allocated on the basis of criteria that are not very precise . 
too many european companies are facing the problem of restructuring , in the name of competitiveness in the global economy , for a fund with an annual ceiling of eur 500 million to be able to meet all needs . 
in writing . - i voted in favour of this report , which gives parliamentary support to the first ever distribution of funds from the european globalisation adjustment fund , which was established with strong pse support to alleviate the effects of globalisation on workers . 
in writing . - ( pt ) the decision to use the new european globalisation adjustment fund and the response to the request from the french government is an opportunity that we should monitor carefully to check whether this fund does actually deliver the desired results . 
according to what emerged from the debate held on the date it was set up , this fund aims to be an institutional reform for solidarity regarding the unforeseen and negative consequences of the globalisation process . 
obviously , the free adjustment of the market will always be a better option than state or equivalent intervention . 
in any event , this fund exists in the context of the european union and of the solutions that the majority of its member states adopt for resolving social crises , so the challenge is to ensure firstly that the results of mobilising it are as expected and secondly that an intervention of this type does not send the wrong signals to the market , thereby unintentionally promoting solutions that eventually create even greater damage . 
since i believe and hope that this will not be the case , i voted in favour of this report . 
( de ) mr president , i would like to thank my fellow members for the result of the vote . 
this is based on the result of the report on the sustainable use of pesticides . 
we have voted out the top levels here . 
we have , however , focussed on training and information for users and salespeople alike . 
only the expert and skilled handling of pesticides can ensure sustainability . 
the latest technology and the most up - to - date knowledge are being applied here , of course . 
we support integrated pest management . 
the commission is calling for integrated pest management to be made compulsory for agriculture as a whole by 2014 . 
we need general standards for this . 
we can not squeeze integrated pest management into fixed criteria , certainly not throughout europe . 
integrated pest management must always be developed flexibly . 
it requires the incitements of good technical practice and it needs drive - and that drive needs to be maintained . 
we must therefore discuss this once again here before second reading . 
we still have the opportunity , together with the council and the commission , to bring this to a good conclusion so that we in the european union can continue to make pest management actually possible . 
mr president , i feel very disappointed that parliament has not done more today on this pesticides package . 
on so many of the more radical and progressive issues , we could have gone very much further . 
but the one area that i want to focus on just now is the area of residents . 
they should be regarded as a specifically vulnerable group , an exposure group in their own right , and a small step has been taken today in order to do that , in the vote that we have just had in this parliament . 
people who live near schools where nearby fields are sprayed and people who work or live near sprayed fields have an enormously high exposure to pesticides . 
they are exposed , on a long - term basis , to mixtures or cocktails of pesticides that are sprayed in their locality throughout the year and , in many cases , for decades . 
until now there has not been any protection for residents as a specific exposure group . 
this is a major and serious public health issue , as farmers clearly can not control pesticides once they are airborne , and studies have shown pesticides can travel in the air for miles . 
i wish we had gone further in terms of our ban on all aerial spraying . 
there have been many reports over the decades of acute and chronic ill - health in rural areas . 
our parliament could have done much more in this vote today to protect people from cancers , from leukaemia , from non-hodgkin 's lymphoma and a whole range of other diseases , and i am very disappointed indeed that we did not take up that option , which had been put forward in the committee on the environment . 
so many of those more positive measures have , sadly , been overturned by the other groups . 
but i hope that people will look at the parliament today and put pressure on their representatives so that , when we come back to a second reading , we can try and do better by the health of people . 
they expect us to do better . 
we should have done better , and i am very sorry the other groups did not support us today . 
( hu ) as a member representing the hungarian democratic forum ( magyar demokrata fórum - mdf ) , i will be using my vote to support both of these draft legislative texts providing for stricter regulations and greater control concerning the use of plant protection products . 
i believe that these provisions represent a milestone on the road towards safer and healthier food production . 
substances that pose a risk to health must be withdrawn , and the overall amount of pesticides we use must be reduced . 
in hungary , for example , the amount of chemicals used is 15 times less than in the netherlands , say , and yet while they existed the european union 's intervention stores were bursting at the seams with hungarian maize . 
we therefore can and must move forward in the direction of producing fruit , vegetables and other foods using sustainable levels of plant protection . 
where member states wish to apply tougher provisions , they should continue to have the possibility of doing so . thank you . 
( cs ) commissioner , i , too , resent the fact that human health is exposed to risk , for example during aerial spraying , and that pesticide use is constantly increasing due to a growing resistance against plant protection . 
there is no doubt that we need to modernise the rules on safe pesticide use in europe . 
i regret however , that here in parliament , through the greens and left - wing members , preference was given to populist proposals such as a ban on pesticide use either in full or at a local level . 
i consider that to be irresponsible .
